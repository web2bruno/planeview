							Venice is a collection of 117 small islands connected by a system of canals and bridges. Access to the city is by boat or train and there is no vehicle access on the main islands. This means that all aspects of Venician life are dependant on deliveries by hand or by boat.

					<p class="description">
							Piazza Saint Marco forms the centerpiece of the main island. The piazza, main square, features St. Marcs Basilica and its characteristic bell tower. During the annual carnival, which marks the start of Lent a girl dressed as a dove descends from the tower to the main square.
